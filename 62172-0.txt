This species of Justicia, long since figured in the _Hortus
Malabaricus_, and described in the _Species Plantarum_ of
LINNÆUS, has been introduced to the Royal Garden at Kew, since
the publication of the _Hortus Kewensis_, by Mr. AITON: it
is a stove plant, producing, almost the year through, abundance of
flowers, distinguished not less for their singularity than their snowy
whiteness; the following description, taken from the living plant, is
fuller than that of LINNÆUS in the _Sp. Pl._

DESCR. Stalk shrubby, somewhat angular, three feet or more in
height, green, very much branched, slightly pubescent; Leaves opposite,
standing on short footstalks, ovato-lanceolate, running out to a short
blunt point, entire, veiny, a little downy; Peduncles from the alæ of
the leaves, alternate, dichotomous, two small bracteæ are placed at
each bifurcation; Flowers pure white, inodorous; Calyx composed of five
lanceolate, entire leaves, continuing; these, as well as the whole of
the plant, are beset with minute transparent globules, visible with
a magnifier. Corolla deciduous, tube linear, grooved, pale green,
slightly villous, bending a little upward; upper lip very narrow, bent
back, bifid at the extremity, the edges toward the base rolled back, so
as to make it appear in that part almost tubular; lower lip depending,
trifid, segments equal, obtuse at the base, round the mouth of the tube
marked with fine purple dots; Filaments two, short, projecting from
the mouth of the tube, finally bending back; Antheræ at first yellow,
afterwards livid; Germen oblong, smooth; Style capillary, slightly
hairy; Stigma bifid.

The plant is increased by cuttings; in the _Hort. Malab._ the bruised
leaves are described as in use for the cure of cutaneous eruptions.

Of the seventy species of Mesembryanthemum described in the _Hortus
Kewensis_, this is the only one with green flowers.

Mr. MASSON introduced it from the Cape in 1774.

The flowers are not only remarkable for their colour, but the extreme
fineness of the florets; they begin to come forth in July, and continue
to be produced till the end of September; the plant is easily increased
by cuttings, is of ready growth, and blows freely.

In Mr. HAWORTH's _Observations on the Genus Mesembryanthemum_,
lately published, there is a very ample description of it, to which
we refer such of our readers as wish for more minute information
respecting it.

We rejoice in the opportunity afforded us, of presenting our readers
with the coloured engraving of a plant recently introduced to this
country, which, as an ornamental one, promises to become an acquisition
highly valuable.

This magnificent species of Chrysanthemum, which we have hitherto
seen only in the collection of Mr. COLVILL, Nurseryman, King's-Road,
Chelsea, began to flower with him early in November last, 1795; and
as there were many buds on the plant, at that time, yet unopened, it
appeared as if it would continue to flower during the early part of the
winter at least.

It is a plant of strong growth; the stem rising to the height of two
or three feet, somewhat woody, much branched, beset with numerous
leaves, having some resemblance to those of Mugwort, of a greyish hue;
the flowers, on being smelt to, discover an agreeable fragrance, they
are produced on the summits of the branches in a loose sort of cluster
(those which terminate the main stem, grow to the size of a large
carnation) of a dark purple colour; they are, it is to be observed,
double, or rather between semidouble and double; the florets of the
radius at first perfectly tubular or quilled, as they advance split
gradually downward on the inside, their outside is of a greyish tint,
which being visible in most of the florets, especially the younger
ones, gives them a particoloured appearance; these florets do not
so completely occupy the receptacle but that room is left for a few
others in the centre, of a different form, and yellow colour, which,
on examination, appear to have their parts perfect, as indeed do those
of the radius; the receptacle is beset with membranous paleæ or chaffy
scales, a circumstance which would lead us to consider this plant
rather as an _Anthemis_ than a _Chrysanthemum_, of which it has the
calyx, with the foliage of _Mugwort_.

New as this plant is to us, it appears to have been cultivated in China
for ages: LINNÆUS, who describes it in his _Species Plantar._
refers us to a figure in the _Hortus Malabaricus_; this figure, and
the description accompanying it, agree generally with our plant, but
the flowers are more double, much smaller, less clustered, and do not
correspond in point of colour, yet there can be no doubt but our plant
is a variety of the same; it is there described as growing in sandy
situations, and having green petals.

RUMPHIUS, in his highly interesting work, the _Herbarium
Amboinense_ is much more minute in his information; he observes, that
these plants were originally brought from China, where they flower in
May and June; that there are two sorts principally cultivated in India,
the white and yellow-flowered, and a third sort, differing only in the
colour of its flowers which are red (the variety, as we suppose, here
figured) began to be known among them at Amboyna; the flowers there do
not expand well, owing to their being produced at the rainy season, and
they decay without producing any seed.

He tells us further, that it is cultivated chiefly for pleasure;
that the natives and the Dutch plant it only in the borders of their
gardens, in which it does not succeed so well as in pots; and that,
if it remains more than two years in the same spot, it degenerates,
becomes less woody, and often wholly perishes; that the Chinese, by
whom it is held in high estimation, pay great attention to its culture;
they set it in pots and jars, and place it before the windows of their
apartments, and that it is not unusual for them when they invite their
friends to an entertainment to decorate their tables with it; on
those occasions, he that produces the largest flower, is considered
as conferring the greatest honour on his guests; besides these three
varieties already mentioned, they have a fourth, which is more rare,
whose flowers are of a greenish ash colour (is not this the var.
figured in the _Hort. Malab._?) all these varieties growing in separate
pots, they place in certain quarters which they particularly wish
to decorate, and the effect they produce is highly pleasing: in the
cultivation of this plant they spare no pains, the shorter it is and
the larger its flowers, the more it is esteemed; to make it dwarfish,
and at the same time productive of flowers, they check its growth;
for, if suffered to grow rude, it assumes a wild nature, and produces
little but leaves when it is coming into flower, of the three blossoms
which usually terminate each branch, they pluck off two, and thus the
remaining flower grows larger; by this, and other management, they
cause the flowers to grow to the breadth of one's hand: he enumerates
still a fifth sort with white flowers, which is extremely rare, and
smaller than the others, called _Tsehuy say si_, that is the _drunken
woman_; its flowers morning and evening flag, and hang down as if
debilitated by intoxication, in the middle of the day they become
erect, and follow the course of the sun; but this (most probably a
distinct species) is not exported from China. Finally, he remarks, that
the Chinese and Malays are so attached to these flowers, that they even
decorate their hair with them.

THUNBERG, in his _Flora Japonica_, enumerates it among the
natives of that country, and describes it as growing spontaneously
in Papenberg, near Nagasaki, and elsewhere, observing, that it is
cultivated for the extreme beauty of its flowers in gardens and houses
throughout the whole empire of Japan, and that the flowers vary
infinitely in point of colour, size, and plenitude. KÆMPFER's
account of it in his _Amæn. Exot._ is very similar.

This Chrysanthemum appears to be a hardy greenhouse plant, and it is
highly probable that, like the _Camellia_ and _Aucuba_, it will bear
the cold of our mild winters without injury.

As it flowers so late, there is but little prospect of its producing
seeds with us, but it may be increased by cuttings, and parting of the
roots.

Of the annual species of _Trifolium_ cultivated by the curious here,
this is one of the largest, as well as one of the most shewy; the
blossoms in the plants which we have had an opportunity of observing,
have been of a bright crimson colour, and have therefore corresponded
badly with the name of _incarnatum_, originally applied to the plant
by some of the old botanists, and adopted by LINNÆUS; like
other Trefoils with red flowers, the blossoms are doubtless found with
different shades of colour, and sometimes wholly white.

It is a native of Italy, a hardy annual, cultivated here by PARKINSON
in 1640, flowers in July, and readily ripens its seeds, by which it is
easily raised. It appears to have been lost out of this country since
its first introduction, as it is not mentioned by MILLER; Mr. AITON
enumerates it among the productions of Kew-Garden, and we last summer
saw several plants of it raised from foreign seeds flowering in the
garden of JOHN SYMMONS, Esq. Paddington-House, Paddington, who has to
boast a collection of hardy herbaceous plants superior to most in this
country; his readiness to oblige me with specimens for drawing on this
occasion, and his various acts of kindness exerted in the promotion of
my botanical views, I have to acknowledge with much gratitude.

  [Illustration: _N^o. 329_]

The _Ononis Natrix_, a plant usually to be met with in all general
collections of greenhouse plants, is a native of Spain, and the South
of France, where it is said to grow wild in the corn-fields.

The general practice sanctioned by that of Mr. AITON, is to
consider this species as tender; Mr. MILLER says it is very
hardy, and recommends it to be planted in the open border, a treatment
likely to suit it in mild winters; there is, however, one part of his
account evidently erroneous, he describes the root as perennial, and
the stem as herbaceous, this is not only contrary to LINNÆUS's
specific description, but to fact, the stalk being undoubtedly shrubby.

As this plant in the course of a year or two is apt to grow out of
form, it is advisable either to renew it frequently by seed, which it
produces in abundance, or to keep it closely cut in.

It flowers from the middle of summer till towards the close, and is
propagated readily either by seeds or cuttings.

Is no novelty in this country, having been cultivated by Mr. JAMES
SUTHERLAND in 1683[1].

DILLENIUS has figured and described this plant in his _Hortus
Elthamensis_ as an _Abutilon_: LINNÆUS in his _Sp. Pl._ has ranked
it with the _Sida_'s, in which he has been followed by Prof. MURRAY,
Messrs. AITON and CAVANILLE; but Prof. GMELIN, in the last edition of
LINNÆUS' _Syst. Nat._ has made another new genus of it, by the name of
_Anoda_; as his reasons for so doing are by no means cogent, we join
the majority in continuing it a _Sida_.

It flowered in the garden of Mr. SHERARD, at Eltham, in 1725, and was
introduced from Mexico, where it is a native: Mr. AITON considers it
a stove plant, as he does the _Tropæolum majus_, and other natives of
South-America; strictly speaking they may be such, but if raised early,
and treated like other tender annuals, this plant will flower and ripen
its seeds in the open ground, as we have experienced at Brompton.

It grows to the height of three feet, or more, producing during the
months of July and August a number of blossoms in succession, which
are large and shewy; the stigmata in this flower are curious objects,
resembling the heads of Fungi in miniature.

  [Illustration: _N^o. 331_]

In this work we have already given three different species of _Kalmia_,
two commonly, and one more rarely cultivated with us, we mean the
_hirsuta_, and which indeed we are sorry to find is scarcely to be kept
alive in this country by the most skilfull management; to these we now
add another species, a native also of North-America, introduced by
PETER COLLINSON, Esq. in 1736, two years after he had introduced the
_latifolia_; CATESBY mentions its having flowered at Peckham in 1743;
it is a low shrub, rarely rising above the height of two feet, growing
spontaneously in swampy ground, and flowering with us from May to July;
there are two principal varieties of it, one with pale and another with
deep red flowers; these two plants differ also in their habits, the red
one, the most humble of the two, not only produces the most brilliant
flowers, but those in greater abundance than the other; Mr. WHITLEY,
who has these plants in great perfection, assures me that it usually
blows in the autumn as well as summer.

This shrub is extremely hardy, thriving best in bog earth, and is
propagated most commonly by layers.

Like the _latifolia_, it is regarded in America as poisonous to sheep.

  [Illustration: _N^o. 332_]

Most of the _Oenothera_ tribe are annual, have large yellow flowers,
which open once only, and that in the evening, displaying their beauty,
and exhaling their fragrance at a time which will not admit of their
being much enjoyed; the present species in some respects deviates from
many of the others, the root is perennial, the flowers which are large
and shewy, though they open in the evening, remain expanded during
most of the ensuing day; the flower-buds, the germen, and the stalk
are enlivened by a richness of colour which contributes to render this
species one of the most ornamental and desirable of the tribe.

It is a hardy perennial, growing to the height of three or four
feet, with us altogether herbaceous, and therefore improperly called
_fruticosa_; a native of Virginia, flowering from June to August: was
cultivated in 1739 by Mr. MILLER.

May be propagated by seeds, by parting of the roots, and also by
cuttings.

  [Illustration: _N^o. 333_]

Ancient writers on plants, supposing that the flowers of this genus
produced abundantly the material of which bees form their wax, gave it
the name of _Cerinthe_, which rendered into English would be wax-flower
or waxwort, not honeywort, by which the genus has long been, and is
now, generally called.

Of this genus there are only two species known, the _major_ and
the _minor_, both happily distinguished by the different form of
their flowers, a part from which it is not common to draw specific
differences, though in some instances they afford the best.

The _major_ varies much, the leaves being sometimes spotted, very
rough, and the flowers of a more yellow hue; this is the sort figured
by GERARD in his Herbal, who mentions its growing in his garden (1597).
MILLER considers this as a species but LINNÆUS, HALLER, AITON, and
others, regard it as a variety; our figure represents the _Cerinthe
glaber_ of MILLER.

This is an annual, remarkable for the singular colour of its foliage;
its flowers, though not very brilliant, possess a considerable share
of beauty; both combined render it worthy a place in our gardens, more
especially as it is a plant of easy culture, coming up spontaneously
from self-sown seeds, and being a native of Switzerland, as well as
the more southern parts of Europe, seedling plants produced in the
Autumn rarely suffer by our winters. It flowers in July, August, and
September.

Of this genus 28 species are enumerated in the _Hortus Kewensis_ of
Mr. AITON, 42 in Prof. MURRAY's _ed._ of the _Systema Vegetab._ and 64
in Prof. GMELIN's 13th ed. of _Linn. Syst. Nat._ of the latter number
14 are described with 5 styles, 46 with 3, 2 with 2 styles, and 2 with
1; when the term _monogynum_ was first applied to this species, it was
a proper one, there being then only one in that predicament, another
having since been discovered it ceases to be so now; some have indeed
doubted the propriety of using the word _monogynum_ at all, alleging
that in reality there are five styles, which manifestly shew themselves
above, though they coalesce below; such is the opinion of my friend,
Dr. GWYN; this is a point on which Botanists will think differently.

This elegant native of China, now common in our greenhouses, appears
from Mr. MILLER to have been first introduced to this country in 1753,
by HUGH, Duke of NORTHUMBERLAND; he tells us, that the plants were
raised in his Grace's curious garden at Stanwick, from whence the
Apothecaries garden at Chelsea was furnished with it.

Mr. MILLER has given us a minute description of this plant,
which he observes is the more valuable, as it continues in flower great
part of the year; he observes further, that if planted in a very warm
situation, it will live in the open air, but that those plants which
stand abroad will not flower in winter, as those do which are removed
into shelter in autumn.

It may be propagated by slips from the root, or by layers.

Prof. JACQUIN, and most modern writers on Botany, consider
the _Ononis_ here figured, as the _rotundifolia_ of LINNÆUS;
it accords certainly with the figure of _Dodon._ to which that author
refers, but is irreconcileable with his description; the leaves for
example are neither _parva_, _integerrima_, nor _glabra_, the words
by which LINNÆUS describes them; they are indeed evidently
serrated in the figure of _Dodon._ which he quotes: by the name of
_rotundifolia_, however, this plant is now very generally known in our
nurseries, to which its beauty has gained it admission. LOBEL
tells us in his _Adversaria_, printed in 1576, that the plant was then
growing in the garden of a Mr. MORGAN; as it is not enumerated
in Mr. MILLER's Dictionary, ed. 6, 4to,[2] we suspect that it
has been lost out of the country and re-introduced.

Baron HALLER informs us, that it is found wild in abundance at
the bottom of the Alps in Switzerland; it is found also in other parts
of Europe.

It flowers in our open borders from May to July, in which it ripens its
seeds, by which it is in general propagated, as also by slips; it grows
to about the height of a foot and a half, is very hardy, and easy of
culture.

The _Lotus hirsutus_, according to LINNÆUS, is a native of the
South of France, Italy, and the East.

In mild winters it will bear the open border with us, but it is more
generally kept in the greenhouse, of which indeed it has long had
possession, being cultivated, according to Mr. AITON, in 1683,
by Mr. JAMES SUTHERLAND.

It flowers from June to August.

Its blossoms are of a white colour, which being contrasted with the
redness of the calyx, gives them a pleasing appearance; CASP.
BAUH. informs us, that they are purple also.

This shrub will acquire the height of several feet; its flowers are
usually succeeded by seed-vessels, which in favourable situations
produce perfect seeds, by which the plant is easily propagated, as also
by cuttings.

The plant here figured, which we have several years cultivated in our
garden at Brompton, without discovering in it the least disposition
to vary, is undoubtedly the same as is figured by Prof. JACQUIN, in
his _Fl. Austr._ under the name of _grandiflora_; he regards it as a
distinct species, and as such it is introduced in Prof. GMELIN's ed. of
the _Syst. Nat._ of LINNÆUS: Mr. AITON, in his _Hort. Kew._ following
LINNÆUS, makes it a variety of the _vulgaris_, a common English plant,
which we have never seen to vary much in the size of its flowers.

Prof. JACQUIN informs us, that it grows wild, mixed with the
_laciniata_ (a kindred species with yellowish flowers) on the Alps; it
is found also in similar situations in various other parts of Europe.

In July and August, it puts forth its large shewy blossoms, of a fine
purple colour.

Such as are partial to hardy herbaceous plants, of ready growth, which
are ornamental, take up but little room, and are not apt to entrench on
their neighbours, will be induced to add this to their collection.

It is propagated by parting its roots in autumn.

This beautiful stove plant (a native of Cayenne and Guiana, where it is
said to grow by the sides of rivers) was introduced to this country in
1785, by Baron HAKE[3]; it has since flowered in many of our
collections, usually in June and July.

Stem or trunk shrubby, upright, climbing to a considerable height;
bark of the old wood pale brown, of the young wood green and smooth;
leaves generally growing four together, sometimes only two, and
those opposite, sessile, smooth and glossy above, paler green
beneath, the midrib on the underside evidently villous, veiny,
veins as in _Plumeria_, terminating before they reach the margin,
chewed discovering little taste; flowers very large, produced even
on young plants, of a fine yellow colour, and somewhat spicy smell,
not terminal, but growing from the sides of the branches, sometimes
singly, more frequently three or four together, standing on short
footstalks; calyx composed of five leaves, lanceolate, smooth, unequal,
short compared with the flower; corolla mono-petalous, funnel-shaped,
tube nearly cylindrical, limb dilated below and bellying out, on the
inside striped with orange-coloured veins, above divided into five
segments, which roll over each other before they open, when Open
broad, somewhat truncated, one side rounded, the other terminating
in a short point; at the base Of the divisions the yellow colour on
the inside of the flower becomes nearly white, forming so many spots;
the mouth of the tube is perfectly closed with villi converging to
a point, and which serve as a covering or species of thatch to five
long, pointed, rigid, arrow-shaped antheræ beneath them, which sit on
the top of so many ridges, projecting from the inside of the tube, and
which just beneath the antheræ are villous; germen nearly round, with a
slight ridge on each side of it, surrounded at its base by a greenish
glandular substance; style filiform, the length of the tube of the
corolla, enlarging as it comes near to the stigma; stigma divisible
into three distinct parts, the lowermost of a yellowish hue, in the
form of a rim turning downwards, the middle of a dark green colour,
secreting honey in considerable quantity; the summit, which perhaps is
the true stigma, a short conical point, rising from the centre of the
middle part, bifid at top with a furrow running down each side of it;
seed-vessels according to the figure in AUBLET, are very large
and prickly.

Of this genus, which has a considerable affinity with that of _Vinca_
and _Plumeria_, only one species is described in LINNÆUS's
works, and this is usually increased by cuttings.

Mr. MILLER in his figure of this plant, to which LINNÆUS refers, has
been more happy in his representation than in that of many others;
RUMPHIUS' figure and description accord also with our plant, some of
his leaves indeed are more perfectly three-lobed than any we have seen
here on the living plant and to this variation, he informs us, they are
subject.

We learn from Mr. MILLER, that roots of this Arum were brought from
Ceylon in the year 1752. It flowers in May and June, and is regarded
both by Mr. MILLER and Mr. AITON as a stove plant; we have seen it
succeed very well with the treatment of a tender greenhouse plant.

It is one of the least of the tribe; its root is like that of the
common Arum, and extremely acrid: but the plant is more particularly
distinguished by the rich, brown, velvety appearance of its flowers;
the length of its tapering spadix, which on its lower part is full
of little cavities, and resembles a piece of metal corroded by long
exposure; and by the intolerable stench which the whole of the flower,
but more especially the spadix, sends forth.

It is a native of Amboyna, as well as of Ceylon. RUMPHIUS
informs us that the roots, sometimes eaten raw by mistake, cause
violent inflammations of the mouth and throat, and that they do not
lose their acrimony even when boiled.

The plant increases freely by offsets from its roots.

  [Illustration: _N^o. 340_]

After receiving various names, this plant has been finally placed by
LINNÆUS among the Milkworts; it retains the trivial name of
_Heisteria_, instead of the generic one previously bestowed on it, in
honour of Prof. HEISTER, the celebrated German Surgeon.

In Holland it appears to have been long since known; but was a stranger
here, till introduced from the Cape, by Mr. MASSON, in 1787.
_Ait. Kew._

In the course of a few years it becomes a shrub of considerable
size, equalling a small furze bush, to which, in its habit, it bears
a distant resemblance; and furze-leaved, in our humble opinion,
would have been a more expressive name than heath-leaved, which Mr.
AITON has given it in accordance with COMMELIN's idea.

The purple of the flowers is brilliant in the extreme, and as those are
plentifully produced almost the year through, it has very generally
obtained a place in collections of greenhouse plants about London.

It is commonly increased by cuttings, but not easily.

  [Illustration: _N^o. 341_]

The _Scilla amæna_, a hardy bulbous plant of small growth, is a
native of the Levant, and has long been cultivated in this country
for ornament, being introduced about the year 1600, by ED.
Lord ZOUCH, (vid. _Park. Parad. & Lobel. Avers._); when it
grows luxuriantly, many flowering stems will spring from the same
root, which, when the plant is in flower, are altogether upright;
as the seed-vessels advance in size and weight, they bend down, the
blossoms are violet-colored, and the germen in the centre of each is
distinguished for the paleness of its colour, a character which did not
escape the observation of PARKINSON.

It flowers early in May, and, in favourable situations, ripens its
seeds in the beginning of June.

Is usually increased by offsets, which are produced in tolerable
abundance; will grow in almost any soil or situation; but will succeed
best if planted in a sandy loam, and a warm sheltered part of the
garden.

Its seeds are of a pale amber colour, and drop soon.

Though Professor JACQUIN figures it in his _Fl. Austriaca_, he
suspects that it had originally been introduced from Constantinople.

The different species and varieties of the African Heaths are now
become so numerous, that there is scarcely any period of the year in
which some of them may not be found to delight the eye with their
blossoms: the _persoluta_ here figured is one of those which flower
early in the spring; through the months of March, April and May, its
branches are loaded with a profusion of bright purple flowers, which,
joined to the lively verdure of its foliage, places it among the most
desirable of the tribe.

If suffered to grow, it will form a shrub of considerable height:
there is a variety of it, called _alba_, whose flowers are nearly
white, yet not wholly divested of a red tinge; to this variety the term
blush-coloured, which Mr. AITON has given to the species,
seems most applicable.

This heath was introduced, from the Cape, by Mr. MASSON, in
1774. _Ait. Kew._

It is increased without much difficulty from cuttings, and is more
easily preserved than many of the others.

Amidst that variety of tender bulbous plants which the Cape affords,
there are none whose flowers can boast a richer scarlet, than the
_Antholyza_ here figured; in their form also, there is a great
singularity, and in their mode of growth much elegance; to us indeed
it is matter of surprise that this plant should not be more generally
cultivated, especially as its culture is attended with so little
trouble: Mr. MILLER, who grew it in 1756, has minutely described it in
his Dictionary; he informs us, that it is easily propagated by offsets,
or raised from seeds; the latter, as the plant flowers in April and
May, ripen about the middle of June, and should be sown about the
middle of August; the plant with the pot in which it has grown, after
it has ripened its seeds, should be set by the shed or some dry place,
and in the autumn the largest roots should be selected, and three of
them planted in a pot of a moderate size, keeping them in an open frame
till the approach of winter, when they are to be removed into the house
with other greenhouse plants.

This species is found wild in Persia as well as at the Cape.

To a magnificent appearance, the blossom of the Protea joins a

difficult to be understood by students, who are apt to consider the
whole as one great simple flower, while in reality it is composed
of a number of florets enclosed within a common calyx formed of
numerous leaves or scales placed one over the other, and sitting on
one common receptacle, being in fact what Botanists term an aggregate
flower, approaching indeed near to a compound one, there being in the
structure and union of the antheræ a considerable similarity to those
of the Syngenesia class, much more so than in the flowers of Plantain,
Scabious, Teasel, and others.

The florets of the present species correspond extremely well with the
character of the genus Leucadendron in the sixth edition of the _Genera
Pl._ of LINNÆUS, but not with that of Protea, as given in
the _Hort. Kew._ and _Gmel. ed. Linn. Syst. Nat._ to which it is now
united; the corolla being most evidently composed of two (not four)
petals, the largest of these is trifid at top, each segment of it,
as well as the summit of the smaller petal, terminates in a twisted
kind of plume, not peculiar to this species; of the antheræ, which are
long, linear, and form a kind of cylinder, three are attached to the
largest petal, the fourth (which appears to be less perfect than the
others) to the smaller petal; the germen is enveloped with numerous
orange-coloured hairs, having the gloss of the richest sattin; the
antheræ terminate in small appendages of a brown colour.

This magnificent shrub, a principal ornament of the Cape-House at Kew,
is a native of the Cape of Good Hope, from whence it was introduced
by Mr. MASSON, in 1774 (_Ait. Kew._); it flowers chiefly in
the Spring, and often during the Summer; is propagated principally by
layers.

Our drawing was made from a plant raised from Cape seeds, which
flowered this season, among a number of others equally curious, in
the collection of Mr. BARR, Nurseryman and Florist, near
Ball's-Turnpike, Kingsland.

Of the several different species of this genus growing in our garden at
this present writing (eleven in number) two only are of a red or purple
colour, the one here figured, and another with a larger flower, which
we purpose soon to publish under the name of _purpurea_.

The present species, Mr. AITON informs us, was introduced in
1783 by Mons. THOUIN, from Peru.

It has been considered as a greenhouse plant, and a perennial; we find
it to be more hardy than greenhouse plants in general, and scarcely
entitled to the distinction of a perennial.

It may be increased by cuttings and seeds, the latter of which
are plentifully produced. It rarely exceeds a foot in height; its
rose-coloured flowers expand during the whole of the day, and are
produced during most of the Summer months.

To guard against accidental severity of weather, sow its seeds in the
Spring with tender annuals; when the plants have acquired a proper age
and the season is favourable, plant them out singly in the open border.

  [Illustration: _N^o. 348_]

To this species of Calceolaria the trivial name of _Fothergillii_ has
been given in honour of Dr. JOHN FOTHERGILL, who introduced it
in 1777 with several other rare plants from Falkland-Islands, where it
is a native.

In the _Hortus Kewensis_ of Mr. AITON it was first figured,
and minutely described.

This plant of great singularity and beauty particularly merits a place
in the collections of the curious; its principal flowering season is in
May, but it will often blossom much later in the Summer.

It is not to be had in perfection, nor even preserved, without great
attention, joined to a peculiar treatment; several times it has been
nearly lost from this country. Mr. AITON makes it a biennial
greenhouse plant; it, no doubt, is one of those plants which are liable
to be killed in very severe weather, and therefore it is necessary to
keep a pot of it at least, during the Winter, either in the greenhouse
or a well-secured frame; but the plant will be found to succeed best in
the open ground, provided it be planted in bog-earth, in a situation
that is moist and moderately shady; with us it has proved perfectly
perennial.

With care it can be propagated by layers and cuttings, but with most
certainty in the former mode; possibly it may be raised from seeds,
they ripen here, but are as fine as dust.

  [Illustration: _N^o. 349_]

Mr. AITON in his _Hort. Kew._ mentions this plant as being a
native of New-Zealand, on the authority of Sir JOSEPH BANKS,
and that it was introduced in 1772; he regards it as a stove plant;
it has been since found to be more hardy than he imagined, and not to
require more heat than the greenhouse affords; in the Summer it will
stand abroad, and even ripen its fruit in the open air.

It is a plant of some beauty, but is more remarkable for having its
antheræ separating widely from each other, and thereby losing the
character of a _Solanum_, so far as it depends on that circumstance.
The berries when ripe are of the size of a small plum, and of a
yellowish green hue; their pulp is sweet, in some small degree
resembling that of a fig, whether it be so innocent we do not take on
us to assert.

It flowers during most of the Summer, and is easily increased by
cuttings or seeds.

  [Illustration: _N^o. 350_]

Of the many new Heaths which have been introduced within these few
years, none have excited greater admiration than the present one; its
blossoms, though they cannot boast the grandeur or richness of colour
so strikingly displayed in the _cerinthoides_, and some others, please
more on a near inspection, they have indeed a delicacy and beauty which
are indescribable; we have given to it the English name of Porcelain
Heath, as the flowers have somewhat the appearance of porcelain, or
enamel.

This species has been introduced from the Cape, since the publication
of the _Hortus Kewensis_; we saw it in blossom many years since, in the
Royal Garden at Kew; several varieties of it have been raised from Cape
seeds by Mr. LODDIGES, Nurseryman, at Hackney, differing in
the hairiness of their leaves, size and colour of their blossoms; but
the best variety we have seen is the one here represented.

In point of form the blossoms resemble those of the _ampullacea_, but
they are not so large, and have no viscidity; the stigma is enclosed
within the mouth of the flower, and the peduncles are usually naked; in
some very luxuriant specimens we have observed a scale or two on them.

It is with Heaths, in some respects, as it is with fruit trees: one
season they will produce blossoms most abundantly, they seem indeed
to overblow themselves, the next few appear; in different years the
blossoms of the same heath will vary also considerably in size. The
_ventricosa_ is a free blower, and will in general produce flowers in
abundance, for two or three months, from June to September.

Those who possess the knack of striking heaths, raise it by cuttings
without much difficulty.

  [Illustration: _N^o. 351_]

LINNÆUS has arranged several distinct species of Saxifrage
under the _Saxyfraga Cotyledon_, but very properly separates this;
though in the general form of its foliage it is as nearly related to
it as most of the others; from four of them it is indeed perfectly
distinct, instead of the sawed cartilaginous edge, it has only fine
soft hairs, more especially towards the base; towards the extremity
there is some appearance of little teeth, but widely differing from
those of the others. The whole plant is covered with viscid hairs; the
stalk about a foot high, is much branched; but the great peculiarity
of this plant consists in its flowers, the petals being long, narrow,
and pointed, and of a saffron colour, of a deeper tint when they first
open, and gradually changing to a pale yellow; the beauty of the
flowers is heightened by a glandular substance in the centre of each,
which when the flower expands is of a bright purple colour.

This rare species of Saxifrage is a native of the Alps of Switzerland
and Italy; we raised it with difficulty from seeds sent us by Mr.
DAVAL, of Orbe, in Switzerland; it was three years before the
plants flowered; those now in bloom in my garden, June 15, bid fair
to produce seeds in abundance; the plant may also be produced from
offsets, in the same way as the _Saxifraga Cotyledon_, vulgarly called
_Pyramidal Sedum_, and requires a similar treatment; though an Alpine
plant, it must be sheltered from much wet and severe frosts.

Baron HALLER describes it with spots on the petals; those
certainly did not exist on our plants.

  [Illustration: _N^o. 352_]

The species of Oenothera here figured is the one we mentioned in
treating of the _rosea_, a very ornamental species, introduced to
the Royal Garden at Kew, from the western coast of North-America, in
1791.[4] We have given to it the name of _purpurea_, it being the only
one in our gardens with purple flowers.

It is distinguished by three principal characters, the glaucous
appearance of its foliage, the purple hue of its blossoms, and the dark
colour of its stigma.

It flowers during the months of July and August, and ripens its seeds
in September; is an annual of ready growth, and worthy of being more
generally introduced to the flower-garden; its seeds should be sown
in the spring, with other tender annuals, and the seedlings when of
a proper age planted out singly in the open border, where they will
acquire the height of two feet, and produce abundance of blossoms
which, like those of the _rosea_, open during the day as well as in the
evening.

_Specific Character._

   MAHERNIA _incisa_ caule hispidulo, foliis lanceolatis incisis,
   stipulis integerrimis.

  [Illustration: _N^o. 353_]

In point of size and mode of growth, this beautiful species comes near
to the _pinnata_ already figured in this work; but differs essentially
in the singular hispidity of its stalks, the form of its leaves, and
the colour of its flowers.

The stalks to the naked eye discover a manifest roughness, a magnifying
glass shews this roughness to be of a singular kind, that they are
beset on every side with little protuberances, from whence issue tufts
of pellucid hairs, and here and there a single hair is discoverable
with a small red viscid globule at its extremity; a portion of the
stalk, when highly magnified, somewhat resembles that of the creeping
Cereus. The leaves, which are not so manifestly hairy as the stalk and
calyces, are deeply jagged on the edges, and bear some little affinity
in their appearance to those of the _Pelargonium tricolor_. The
flowers, when in bud, are of the richest crimson imaginable; as they
open they incline to a deep orange, and finally become of a yellowish
hue.

As this plant produces abundance of blossoms, they may be seen in all
their states during most of the Summer and Autumnal months.

The plant from whence our drawing was taken, flowered this Summer with
Mr. COLVILL, Nurseryman, King's-Road, it requires the same
treatment as the _pinnata_, is probably a native of the same country,
and may be propagated by cuttings in the same manner.

  [Illustration: _N^o. 354_]

The present species of _Mimulus_, equal in point of shew to most of
the inhabitants of our greenhouses, to which situation it is adapted,
flowered this Summer with Mr. COLVILL, Nurseryman, King's-Road.

Stalk about three feet high, much branched, shrubby, round, the
young wood green, with a tinge of purple toward the lower part of
each joint, slightly viscid, as it becomes older changing to a light
brown colour, and discovering manifest fissures; branches alternately
opposite, flower-bearing quite to the base; leaves opposite, sessile,
slightly connate, ovato-lanceolate, somewhat blunt at the extremity,
this bluntness is particularly apparent when contrasted with a leaf
of the _ringens_, toothed or slightly sawed on the edge, smooth,
veiny; flowers inodorous, large, nearly twice the size of those of
the _ringens_, uniformly pale orange, growing in pairs from the alæ
of the leaves, standing on footstalks about half the length of the
calyx; calyx five-angled and five-toothed, tube of the flower within
the calyx, narrow, cylindrical, pale yellow, bent a little downward,
gradually expanding, and dividing into two lips, the upper lip divided
into two, the lower lip into three segments, all of them irregular,
the two uppermost very much so; at the base of the middle segment of
the lower lip are two prominent ridges, of a somewhat deeper colour;
stamina four, two long, two short; antheræ deep orange, cruciform,
within the flower; stigma white, two-lip'd, lips closed or expanded
according to its age; style filiform; germen oblong; at the base of the
germen is a gland of considerable size which secretes much honey.

This plant flowers during most of the Summer, and is increased by
cuttings. We know not with certainty of what country it is a native.

  [Illustration: _N^o. 355_]

From all the species of Oenothera with yellow flowers hitherto
introduced to this country, the present one is distinguished by the
inferiority of its size; in its most luxuriant state it rarely exceeds
a foot in height, and as it commonly grows it is far more humble:
from a perennial root it sends out many flowering stems, which are
productive of blossoms in regular succession from April to July: these
are open in the morning as well as in the evening, which renders the
plant more ornamental and desirable: for the border of a small garden,
or for rock-work, it is extremely suitable, if not so shewy as some
others; it is very hardy, of ready growth, not apt to encroach, flowers
during most of the summer months, and is readily propagated by seeds,
cuttings, or dividing of the roots in autumn.

Is a native of North-America, and was cultivated here by Mr.
MILLER in 1757. _Ait. Kew._

The stalks cannot be considered as prostrate, though LINNÆUS
describes them as such; _adscendentibus_ would be a more appropriate
term.

This very magnificent African Heath is first described in the _Suppl.
Pl._ of the younger LINNÆUS, and named in honour of Mr. MASSON, whose
exertions at the Cape, where he resided many years as collector of the
natural productions of that fertile spot, have so eminently contributed
to render the royal collection at Kew, in this tribe of plants
especially, rich in the extreme.

This Heath grows to a considerable height, and becomes much branched,
the branches are long and upright, covered closely with numerous hoary
leaves, nearly cylindrical, most of these terminate in a large umbel
of flowers, which continue a long while in bloom, and are so extremely
viscous that scarcely a winged insect can settle on them and escape
with its life; the formidable wasp sometimes becomes its victim, as we
once had an opportunity of seeing.

When the _Hort. Kew._ was first published, this species had not
flowered with Mr. AITON, it has since done so in many collections
near town, and no where in greater perfection than at Messrs. LEE and
KENNEDY's, Hammersmith, on some one or other of whose plants blossoms
may be seen during most of the summer.

It is raised from cuttings with extreme difficulty, is not so easily
kept as some others, and is more susceptible of injury from moisture.

The Grasses are in general more regarded for utility than ornament, yet
in the latter point of view many of them have engaged the attention of
the curious, and long held a place in the flower-garden, to which they
have a twofold claim, as they not only decorate the garden when fresh,
but the mantle-shelf when dry; to these purposes the present species of
Briza has long been applied: JOHNSON tells us, in his time,
1633, "it was sowen yearlely in many of the London gardens."

This species, a native of Spain and Italy, blossoms in June and July,
and ripens its seeds in August.

Where it has once seeded it comes up spontaneously, without the trouble
of sowing it; autumnal seedlings make the strongest plants, they are
liable however to be cut off in very severe seasons; should that
happen, sow more seed in the spring with your other annuals.

SEBA, a Dutch writer, appears first to have noticed this
Heath; he figures it in his Museum, and distinguishes it by the name of
Arbutus-flowered, which Mr. AITON has retained.

This very elegant and ornamental species grows to a considerable
height, and in favourable situations produces abundance of flowers
early in the summer, which are remarkable, though not peculiarly so,
for being enveloped with a calyx of same colour.

It is a native of the Cape, and was introduced by Mr. MASSON
in 1774[5].

Is raised from seeds, which it ripens with us more freely than most
of the African Heaths, a fortunate circumstance, as it is scarcely
possible to strike its cuttings.

Seedling plants rarely flower till they are three years old.

  [Illustration: _N^o. 359_]

The name of _Althæoides_ and the description of LINNÆUS accord much
better with the figure of this plant, as given by CLUSIUS, than with
the plant itself as cultivated in our gardens: whether the foliage
of our plant becomes smaller and more finely divided by cultivation;
whether it be a distinct species, as MILLER affirms, or a permanent
variety, as Mr. AITON makes it, we have not been able satisfactorily to
ascertain; the former gives no description of the radical leaves of his
_elegantissimus_, and we have not found in any of our gardens a variety
different from the one here figured. This species of Convolvulus,
though cultivated here by J. TRADESCANT in 1656, is far from being
common, which is the more surprising, as the plant is easy of culture
and productive of flowers at once large and beautiful, and peculiarly
interesting from the extreme variableness of its silky foliage,
expanding into the most elegant forms imaginable.

Mr. STEVENS, of Camerton-House, near Bath, informs me that it
grows abundantly on the mountains near Victri, southeast of Naples, and
in the Isle of Capri, mixed with _Convolvulus Cneorum_, _Lithospermum
fruticosum_, &c. and in the adjacent islands and continent, forming a
beautiful ornament to the shrubs it entwines: CLUSIUS observed
it in Spain and Portugal.

It flowers with us in June and July, and is increased without
difficulty by parting its roots, which are of the creeping kind, in
spring or autumn. It is usually kept in the greenhouse, but will
succeed very well in the open border, guarding it against the unusual
severity of weather.

Those who "admire Nature's clocks more than her watches," will view,
we presume, with some pleasure our representation of this very superb
species of Hibiscus, a native of Carolina, and cultivated here by Dr.
JOHN FOTHERGILL, in 1778.

This species is altogether herbaceous, and from a perennial root yearly
throws up a stem to the height of many feet, clothed with foliage of
a beautiful form and smoothness, and supporting at its summit several
flowers, distinguished for their grandeur and richness of colour; these
usually blossom in August, and if the plant be kept in the stove, as
it most commonly is, are followed by ripe seeds, by which it is most
commonly propagated.

In the _Hort. Kew._ it is marked as a greenhouse plant; it may no
doubt be preserved in the greenhouse; there is even no impediment to
its growing in the open border, if placed in a warm and sheltered
situation; and the only motive for keeping it in the stove is its being
found to flower there more advantageously, and to ripen its seeds with
more certainty.
